                        <p>MSIT programme adds great value to its students' career path and this is reflected in the placements 
                            as it produces "employable students". Students can avail themselves of the placement opportunities 
                            in their respective Learning Centers. CIHL also helps in the placement activity. Major companies that

                        <h1 className="jumbotron">Corporate Relationships</h1>
                        <p>The proof of concept of any program lies in industry acceptance. MSIT has a strong tie up with the 
                            software Industry to understand the pulse of the market and be prepared to beat the competition. 
                            Based on inputs from the stalwarts of the IT market the curriculum is enriched and tailored to be 
                            suitable for the ever changing needs and pressing demands of the industry. This close participation 
                            and collaboration with the industry creates a win-win situation for both the industry and the MSIT 
                            Program. The MSITians get the best of the courses based on technologies that are likely to be 
                            prevalent when these students hit the market and also benefit from the interactions with the 
                            bigwigs like the CEO and VPs of companies like GATI which come to visit MSIT and share their 
                            experiences with the students about how the industry runs and what it needs. On the other hand 
                            the industry gets 'Ready to work' students who understand and can translate the ideas of the CEO 
                            into path breaking software solutions. Apart from technical competency the industry looks for 
                            people who possess good softskills. Again MSIT fits the bill because of its unique soft skills 
                            program that is delivered with the support of C and K Management Limited.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Starting from the preparatory course to the domain specializations and practicum the industry 
                            interaction in MSIT is commendable. During the preparatory course Mr. Sriram of Vital Technologies,
